### Rating

For this game overall, I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars.

## Summary

This game is about what would happen if a zombie apocalypse were to happen, but the only thing you had to defend yourself, was plants. In this case though, the plants are very powerful friends to fight for you and defend your house from zombies, and keep them from eating your brains.

This is a tower defense type game, with the end goal beaing to successfully defend your house from hordes of zombies. At the start of the game, you start with only a few, but really good power plants, as well as only having to deal with a few types of zombiesa and small waves of hordes, but as you progress throughout the game, you start dealing with even bigger waves of zombie hordes, as well as new types of zombies that attack in a variety of different ways.

As you deal with even more dangerous zombies, you gain access to new plants to plant out on the battlefield, some dedicated to getting more sunflower points to plant more plants, some to attack the zombies and counter other certain zombies, and other plants specifically built for defense. You never feel like the game is going to suddenly going to do a complete 180 and do soemthing that'll make you get a game over instantly, but the game does teach you how to set up and prepare for the hordes of zombies that come your way.

## Final Thoughts

So overall, this is a really fun game to play that builds in difficulty as you go. You feel prepared and ready to take on anything, while still dealing with a really good challenge. It's really fun considering the seemingly infinite combinations of plants you can put out on the battlefield to fight against the many different types of zombies that come out to attack. It's overall presentation is very nice and clean as well, the artstyle fits in very well with it's wacky quirkyness as well.
