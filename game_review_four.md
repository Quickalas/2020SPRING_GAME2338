### Rating

My rating for this game is a 8 out of 10.

## Summary

The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD is a entry in the series that has a heavy focus on the sea and the little ship you use to sail across it. It is also an upgraded port all the way from the gamecube, updating quality of life enhancements as well as the graphics visually.

In this game, you traverse the seas as Link, the main character of the series, in order to save his sister, who has been kidnapped. Throughout your adventure, you will come across many dugeons, islands, and enemies as you soon will also look for the triforce, a mainstay that is a hige focus throughout the series.

One other big aspect is your ship and your use of the wind waker item. Throughout the game, since you're traveling throughout the Great Sea, your boat will be your best friend in the game, occasionally coming into hurricanes and tornadoes but also cool things like secrets and treasure chests to fish for. The Wind Waker is an item that has many different spells within it essentially, with one of the spells being to control the direction of the wind, which can help to give you a boost in sailing off on the sea.

It's presentation is very nice and presentable for this entry, with its cel-shaded cartoon art style, along with the updated graphics, makes the game look very beautiful.

## Final Thoughts

There are many things that I love so much about the game, such as the updated visual graphics in the game. In the original gamecube version, Nintendo could only do so much to convey the bright cartoony visual art style, but when they ported it to the Wii U, it became more bright and colorful, truly showing what this game was meant to look like. Remakes and Remasters are a huge topic on its own, but I agree that Wind Waker HD is how a Remaster should be done, by adding more quality of life enhancements and upgrading the visuals of the original game.

The updated graphics do kind of come with some negatives here and there, but not too much. Sometimes when you're either indoors or next to a light source such as a torch, it can mess around with the shadows that wrap around your character. Another thing is the big open world, in this case, it's the Great Sea with many islands in the world. Although sometimes some islands are close and quick to travel to, traveling to very far islands can take very long and feel isolating. It may be doing it's way to interpret how long it would take to travel from area to area, but in my opinion, it shouldn't take too long to get to places. I don't mind sailing across the seas, since that is one main aspect of the game, but I do believe that it can find a balance with it, such as controlling the dircetion of the wind with the wind waker item, which is a great step in the right direction.
