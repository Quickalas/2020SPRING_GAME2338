### Rating

Overall, I would give this game an 7.5 out of 10.

## Summary

This game is about the start of the Zombie Apocalypse in the Walking Dead Universe. You play as Lee, whose on his way to prison for a crime that we don't know of yet. He comes across his first encouter with the Zombies(called Walkers in this story), but luckily gets out of there and survives, he then finds a little girl named Clementine who's all by herself, and is waiting for her parents to come home. Lee promises to look out for her and take care of her and help her find her parents while all of this is happening. Eventually they come across and join new groups of survivors doing their best to survive, and try to make the best out of this.

The Game takes inspiration from point & click games walking around in a 3D envrionment and investigating clues around the current level/area, and visual novel games where you get to choose the response you say to other people, as well as make certain choices in a limited amount of time, making everything more intense as certain choices can affect the entire game. This game also runs in 5 chapters, also called episodes, that can run up to 2-3 hours each to play, with an continuing story, divided into separate parts, allowing for more storytelling and pacing throughout the game as well.

## Final Thoughts

When I first played this game, I was immeresed. Very Immersed. The storytelling in this game is phenomenal, and makes me care for Lee and Clementine, hoping that they'll be able to make it out of this alive. The choices I made in my first run as well also felt very important, as they defined my relationships to other characters of the story based on certain things I did such as, choosing who I have to save when I only have time to save one of them, choosing who to side with in something that can end really badly, or seeing the effects of your choice that you made in one episode, highly affecting something in another episode.

That said, I don't believe this game works well for replay-ability, even though that this is a game that you can make different choices on, as you can just look them up or can easily tell what the other choice would end up as, or sometimes you realize some choices are just an illusion and don't affect anything at all, which can make certain events in the game make you feel less in control at times.
