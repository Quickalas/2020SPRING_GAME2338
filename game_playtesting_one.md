**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules of the game were very understandable to me and everything was clear. This could have been my first ever time playing 3D Video Games, and because of this game, I would still understand where to go and how to play this game, as it instructed me and guided me on what to do.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ I didn't really noticed anything in this game that should be removed, because in my opinion, the way that Nintendo polishes and creates thier video game titles have a lot of quality within them, making the games even more fun to play.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ This game is pretty well balanced in my opinion, as since it is an open world game, you can just take your nice pace with it and experience the world, or if you want to, you could charge straight through and instantly challenge the final boss if you so desire to, which allows for fun replayability as well as fun and unique exploration within the game.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ I believe so, because when this game was realeased, it was alongside the release of the newest Nintendo Console, the Nintendo Switch, and this game was one of the biggest games to debut on it, not only helping sales of the game itself, but the entire console as a whole!

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics and theme blended in very well together and it was awesome. Since this game is about the exploration of the open world, you get rewarded the more you explore, which is a really great incentive for this game

> _Answer:_ I had a lt of fun playing this game, and I still am to this day.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
