### Rating

I rate this game a perfect 10 out of 10 in my opinion

## Summary

This game is about moving characters of your group around a grid based environment taking turns between the enemy phase and the player phase, while incorporating story within the turn based battles. Something that this turn based game series does different from other series is the aspect of permadeath. In this game, if one of your character's health points reaches 0, that means that they actually die and you lose them as a unit to control for future maps, but also the fact that you may have bonded with them, encouraging the idea to play more carefully, but more strategically with this game as well.

This iteration of Fire Emblem is currently the newest one in the series, and what this game adds are two major things. One of them is the academy phase, where before you go into battle, you can walk around an academy that your characters live in and speak to them about current story events in the game, or interact with them to raise support points and make them more stronger in battle. The other one is choosing which exact house you will decide to align with once you are at the academy, and based upon which of the three that you choose, the story will take a massive turn overall, allowing for huge replayability.

This version of Fire Emblem also brings 2 main aspects back that were exclusive in previous entries in the series. One is the 5 year timeskip phase, where at one point in your story, events will occur that will cause a 5 year timeskip, allowing you to see how the characters that came from the house that you choose to side with in the beginning grew over time and see thier character development. Another feature that has returned is the ability to rewind the turns in the turn based battles, so for example, if you have made a mistake or had a character die, you can rewind that turn and fix your mistakes, but you can only rewind so much, so you have to consider your current strategies.

## Final Thoughts

I really loved this game for it's story and interacting with all of the characters within this game, and not only was it fun story wise, but it was also very fun in the gameplay aspect with what I think was awesome turn based rpg gameplay. The new take on training your characters as well as bonding and interacting with them makes it feel more important to avoid death within the game as well as allowing for replayability considering the fact that there are multiple paths within this game and making you have thought about how things could go different in each timeline, making this game a really awesome one for me.
