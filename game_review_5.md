## Summary

Celeste is about a girl named Madeline with no mountain climbing experience whatsoever, who has the goal to climb a mountain for her own reasons. As she ventures towards the top, she finds many more challenges within it including battling her anxiety as well as her inner demons that actually self materialize into a spearate entity. Fortunately, she finds a few other people on this isolated mountain with their own stories, as well as helping her out on her journey, showing that its okay to have help from others in order to help and find yourself. Even near the end, as she reaches the top, she talks literally to the entity that is her "bad side" becomes good and teams up with her rather than against her, making Madeline learning her true potential to reach the top.

The Gameplay here is glorious and beautiful. As a platformer, you of course have the ability to walk and jump, but in this game, you have the ability to fly real quickly in a specific direction as well, which adds a lot of variety in the level design as well. Something that each new level does is that it adds a slighlty new mechanic in the level, adding even more variety and fun. In game development, it's good to implement a tool that is used in a variety of ways, and Celeste successfully does it well. Celeste is indeed a hard game and you will die many times throughout it. That is though, works very well with it, as in the game, when you die, you restart instantly, unlike most games like mario where you die, play death animation, game over jingle, then start way back. You think dying too much would be band for this game, but it works well as Celeste has its own ways of bringing you back in the game, and you the player feel the need to get back there and succeed.

## Final Thoughts

At first, something I thought I wouldn't like about this game is it's difficulty and how much you would die, but I actually enjoyed that aspect of the game. The game truly has its way of motivating you, and wanting you to get back in, in order to win, which feels so rewarding. One huge thing I loved about this game is it's story, and it's relationship about battling anxiety that I resonate with so well, making me feel even more connected to this game.
