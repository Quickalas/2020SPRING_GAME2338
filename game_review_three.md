## Summary

Animal Crossing New Leaf is a game about, well, mostly nothing! The way the game works is pretty simple. The closest thing to a main winning goal is paying off your mortgage to Tom Nook, a Tanooki that builds a house for you, but even then, you don't have to worry much, as you can take your time, nicely.

What makes Animal Crossing New Leaf different from it's other iterations is that it makes you the mayor in the game. The way that it changes the game, is that it lets you decide how your village grows. You may decide you'd like the village to have more nature and have villagers be more of the early bird type, or you may want more focus on your economy in the town while also have people be more night owls.

This game also runs on an internal clock. What that means is if it's currently 7AM in real time, you can see the sunset within the game itself, and around 8PM, you could probably see the night sky and full moon! Different events occur on different days of the calender too, which encourages the player to come back to the game every day to play even more.

Now, why would you play this type of game? There's no end goal, no enemies to fight, and no types of game overs whatsoever. Well, it is you that gives the game purpose. For example, one day in the game, you may decide to talk to some villagers and see what they want, or maybe you want to go to the nearby island to go fishing, or maybe you just wanna save up some money in the game to buy some new furniture for your house. Essentially, whatever you want to do in the game is up to you, and that is the aspect that whoever plays this game loves about it.

## Final Thoughts

First, I'll talk about what I didn't like in Animal Crossing New Leaf. I didn't really enjoy some of the customization features that much. In a game where you can also design your patterns for your clothes, buy furniture for your house, and decorate the entire village itself, there were times it felt like I really couldn't get creative with it, most likely due to its limitations at its current point.

Besides that though, I loved everything else about the game. The freedom that this game gives you is wonderful to check out. Although the game is pretty simple and easy, you never feel like your holding someone's hand throughout the game, and you can choose to do what you want. Another thing I loved about this game is the villagers. You can only have up to a maximum of 10 other villagers in this town, but there are hundreads of villagers that exist within the game, with many different personalities, making interactions with these characters so fun to watch! One more thing I really loved was it's presentation, as although it's a 3D game, it's not only from a top down view, but the world itself is shaped like a log essentially, giving the world an even more round feel and aesthetic to it.
